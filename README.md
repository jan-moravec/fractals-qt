# fractals-qt
Fractals generating and painting in Qt with C++.

## Fractals
Fractals are beautiful and complicated mathematical objects that are quite easy to program and display.

This project chooses the Mandelbrot fractal, but is prepared for different ones in the future.

## C++ and Qt
Program was created with Qt Creator and Qt version 5.9.1 under Windows, but it should be compatible with Linux or MAC.

Project shows basic stuff from Qt - creating UI designs, signals, and threads and overriding the paint method.

## Application
The application enables user to paint fractal with different color palettes. 

User can change the resolution, number of iteration and zoom in infinitely to explore beautiful parts of the fractal.

## Binaries
Here can be downloaded precompiled application to try it (for Windows):
